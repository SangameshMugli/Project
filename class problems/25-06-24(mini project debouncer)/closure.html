    <h1>What is Closure?</h1>
    <p>closure concepts defines the below points mentioned :
        <ol>
            <li>Inner function will be enclosed with the references to its surrounding 
                state where it was declared.</li>
            <li>This references to surrounding state will allow function to access and 
              manipulate those references even after the outer function scope has finished executing.
            </li>
            <li>Aclosure gives us access to outerfunctions scope from an inner function</li>

            <li>OR</li>
            <li>Closure: The innerfunction forms a closure. A closure is a function that retains
             access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope.</li>

             <li>lexical scope means that a function's scope is defined by its location within 
                the source code, and nested functions have access to variables declared in their outer scopes.</li>

        
        </ol>
    </p>
